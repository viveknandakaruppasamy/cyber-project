■ Overview
Footprinting is the first phase of Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing. It involves gathering
information about a target system to identify potential vulnerabilities. This project demonstrates both
active and passive footprinting techniques using various tools and methods.

■ Types of Footprinting
• Active Footprinting → Directly interacting with the target system (e.g., ping, DNS lookup).
• Passive Footprinting → Collecting information from publicly available sources without directly
contacting the target.

■ Purpose of the Project
• Understand the importance of footprinting in cybersecurity.
• Demonstrate how attackers gather information about targets.
• Learn how cybersecurity professionals use the same techniques to strengthen security.

■ Tools & Techniques Used
• Social Media Enumeration → LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter (X)
• Hacking Search Engines → Shodan.io, Notevil, DuckDuckGo, Censys, Nslookup
• Google Dorking → Extract specific data/documents from websites
• Technology Detection → Netcraft, Wappalyzer
• Subdomain Finder → Find subdomains of websites
• Link Extractor → List all URLs of a target website
• Buffer Size Check → Using ping command
• TLS/SSL Analysis → SSL Labs
• Security Headers → SecurityHeaders.com
• Website Time Travel → Wayback Machine

■ Screenshots Included
• Social media information gathering
• Nslookup & Shodan.io
• Google Dorking results
• Netcraft & Wappalyzer technology detection
• Subdomain and URL extraction
• Buffer size verification
• SSL certificate analysis
• Security header check
• Wayback Machine results

■ How to Run This Project
• Choose a target website (educational/demo purposes only).
• Use the mentioned tools (online/offline) to gather data.
• Record results and take screenshots.
• Document findings in a structured way (like in this project).

■■ Note: This project is for educational and ethical use only. Do not use footprinting techniques on
unauthorized systems.

■ Learning Outcomes
• Learned to differentiate between active and passive footprinting.
• Gained hands-on experience with information gathering tools.
• Understood how attackers collect sensitive details.
• Learned how to mitigate risks by securing information leakage.
